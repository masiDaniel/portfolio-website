        I'm Daniel Masi, a passionate software developer and problem solver with expertise in Flutter, Django, Python, and AI.<br /><br />

        I enjoy building innovative tech solutions, from mobile and web applications to machine learning models and ERP systems.<br /><br />

        Currently, I serve as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at a medical company, where I design, develop, and maintain software solutions that enhance healthcare services. My experience includes working on projects in fintech, e-commerce, real estate, and AI-driven applications.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond coding, I love tackling real-world challenges, mentoring aspiring developers, and exploring cutting-edge technologies like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.
        <br /><br />
        My goal is to create impactful, scalable, and sustainable software solutions that drive meaningful change.
